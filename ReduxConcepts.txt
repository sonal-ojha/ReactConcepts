### Steps to Follow

1.Store - create store. createStore is a function acailable from 'redux'. It accepts 2 arguments.
  -> Reducers
  -> dev tools

2.Provider : Import 'Provider' from 'react-redux' & Add Provider as the parent component of 'App' component in index.js file.
  store is passed as a 'prop' & It makes the Redux store available to the rest of your app.

3.Action: A function where you make Fetch API calls and dispatch action types based on response received.

4.Reducer: They are Pure Functions. Used to update data in the Store.
  you should never mutate state directly(in store).use spread ... syntax to return New State every Time.

5.Connect: is a HOC. It connects a React component to a Redux store. 
  It does not modify the Component you passed to it; Instead, it returns a New Component.
  Accepts 2 arguments
    -> mapStateToProps
    -> mapDispatchToProps

mapStateToProps: Is a function and returns a "object" that contains the data(from Store) the component needs
NOTE: ** Whenever the data in store changes, all of the mapStateToProps functions of all of the connected components will run.

mapDispatchToProps: Is a Function used for dispatching "Actions" to the store.
  Expected to return an "object". Each field of the object should be a function, calling which is expected to dispatch an action to the store.
